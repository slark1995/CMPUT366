## Assignment3 has two part of coding program:
### First coding part is in direction /CMPUT366ASS3/Program1

- you may need change parameters in ==valueIteration.py== like discount value, probability of head, small positive number these global variable are alread commended by "you may change it"

- RUN > ==pythpm2.7 valueIteration.py==

-  After finish runing, in direction of Program1, valueIteration creates two files: 1. Value.npy  2. Policy.npy

- RUN > ==python2.7 plot.py== ,Then It shows message "V(1) or Pi(2), enter 1 or 2: " 

  Make sure that you enter 1 or 2; 1 for value figure and2 for policy figure

### Second coding part is in direction /CMPUT366ASS3/Program2

- you may need change parameters in ==mc_agent.py== , for example: discount(gamma), epsilon and so on.Those varibales are already commented with "you may need change it"

- RUN > ==pyhton2.7 gambler_exp.py== , then RUN> ==python2.7 plot.py== to get plot.
